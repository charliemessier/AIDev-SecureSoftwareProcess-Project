Project Report

Throughout this project, my main focus was exploring secure software development by analyzing a large dataset of AI-generated pull requests. The goal was to better understand what types of security-related tasks agentic AI tools are performing, and how often they touch areas involving vulnerabilities, patches, or risky code changes. To do that, I worked with the AIDev dataset hosted on HuggingFace, which contains almost a million pull requests created by various autonomous coding agents.

The first part of the project involved writing Python scripts to pull data directly from HuggingFace and convert it into organized CSV files. For Task 1, I extracted key pull request information such as the title, body, agent name, and repository details. Task 2 focused on pulling repository metadata like languages and star counts. In Task 3, I generated CSV files containing the PR classification labels and confidence scores. For Task 4, I processed commit-level details, including filenames, commit messages, and code patches, while cleaning the diff data to avoid encoding issues. Each of these tasks required reading large Parquet files, mapping specific fields, renaming columns, and exporting everything into clean CSV outputs.

The final part of the project (Task 5) brought everything together. Using the outputs from the earlier tasks, I created a script that merged the pull request data with the task-type classifications and scanned each PR’s title and body for security-related keywords. The script assigned a “SECURITY” flag (1 or 0) depending on whether any of those keywords showed up. This made it possible to quickly identify which AI-generated pull requests were related to security fixes, vulnerabilities, patches, bugs, or other security-sensitive changes.

Overall, this project gave me a much deeper understanding of how agentic AI tools behave in real development environments, especially when it comes to security. It also gave me hands-on experience with cleaning large datasets, writing reusable Python scripts, working with Parquet files, generating structured CSV outputs, and using GitHub for code organization. Most importantly, it helped reinforce how important it is to properly classify, analyze, and review security-related work, especially as AI systems continue to take on bigger roles in software development.
